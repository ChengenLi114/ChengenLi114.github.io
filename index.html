                From the beginning, the hermetically-inspired magician was hip deep
                in data. In Mind to Hermes, the eleventh treatise of the Hermeticum,
                Mind promises that "If you embrace in thought all things at once,
                time, place, substances, quantities, qualities, you will comprehend
                God.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Part of the hermetic urge was encyclopedic, and magicians hoarded a
                stunning amount of information: ritual names and astrological
                correspondences; numerological techniques; ciphers, signs and
                sigils; lists of herbs, metals, incense and talismanic images--all
                of which were used to capture astral forces.

            But the <span class="highlight">magician</span> needed to organize
            this vast arcana, and he employed techniques derived from a classical art highly relevant to issues of
            computer representation:

                As described by Cicero and other rhetoricians, and discussed at length in Francis
                Yates' remarkable Art of Memory, the art consisting of mentally creating a series of imaginative spaces,
                usually a vast building, rigorously constructed down to the right size and even the right lighting.

                Within these units were placed images of the things or words to be remembered, ranging from striking
                figures of bloody gods to simple emblems like anchors or swords. By "walking" through the phantasmic
                palace, one could locate the appropriate icon, and then recover its store of words and information.

                The rhetorician Seneca could hear a list of two thousand names and
                spit them back in order. Later in the Middle Ages, a truncated form
                of the art was transformed by the scholastics into a didactic
                technique for al legorically representing the church's innumerable
                vices and virtues.

                Rather than use the palaces of the classical world, the schoolmen
                often lodged their data in the multilayered onion of the cosmos
                itself, that dense vertical bureaucracy of hell purgatory and heaven.

                Yates even argues that Dante's Divine Comedy
                was in many ways a product of the art of memory, as it followed the
                classical rule of "striking images on orders of places.

                The brilliant medieval Neoplatonist Raymond Lull took a different
                tack in his mnemonic art, which he claimed would enable the user to
                know everything that was going on in the universe and retain the
                information.
                <span>Lull's art consisted of an abstract and incredibly
                complex system of wheels within wheels.</span>
            </p>
            <p>The rims of these wheels were inscribed with letters which stood for the nine qualities of God that Lull
                had seen in a vision, qualities which reflected and organized the sum of all knowledge. But "Doctor
                Illuminatus," as Lull was called, added a fascinating twist: by shifting the wheels, one could create
                endless combinations of concepts.
            </p>
            <p>Lull's art was thus an ancestor of symbolic logic, and influenced Leibniz's development of calculus. In
                Magical Alpha bets, Nigel Pennick points out that Lull's combinatorial wheels could also be seen as the
                forerunner of Charles Babbage's 19th century difference engine--which used a system of gears to perform
                polynomial equations--and "hence can be considered the occult origin of modern computers."
            </p>
            <p>We may forgive Pennick as a practicing geomancer, but the far more sober Yates makes a similar suggestion
                when she describes the highly systematized and profoundly magical memory-charts in the De umbris idearum
                of the Renaissance genius Giordano Bruno (who ended his heretical days on a Vatican pyre, a "martyr to
                science" who was actually a flagrant pagan). Bruno's systems were of "appalling complexity," combining
                Lull's interlocking wheels with a dense iconography of star demons derived from astrological
                applications of the art of memory ("demons," here as throughout this essay, does not imply evil, but like
                the term "daemon," describes spiritual entities that
                can range from gnomes to planetary rulers to archangels).
            </p>
            <p>
                Like Lull's Art, Bruno's system was meant to
                be internalized in the imagination, for like most hermeticists, Bruno believed that "the astral forces
                which govern the outer world also operate within, and can be reproduced or captured there to operate a
                magico-mechanical memory." Yates saw a " curiously close" spiritual link between Bruno's memory system
                and the "mind machines" discussed in the 1960s.
            </p>
            <p>At the very least, this link attests to the continuity between the impulses of magic and the scientific drive
                towards technological mastery, a drive which in some ways is
                realized in the universal machine. As Yates writes, "the Renaissance conception of an animistic
                universe, operated by magic, prepared the way for the conception of a mechanical universe, operated by
                mathematics." Yet as our own mind machines push the boundaries of the atomized, mechanical universe
                towards self-organization, complexity and artificial life, Bruno's conception of a densely
                interconnected universe alive with constant communication flickers on the screen, like some ghostly
                landscape arising from a hazy childhood recollection.

                In his Confessions, Saint Augustine gives a remarkable sense of what it must feel like to use the
                artificial memory, describing "the plains, and caves, and caverns of my memory, innumerable and
                innumerably full of innumerable kinds of things." Augustine calls this an "inner place, which is as yet
                no place," and catalogs the images, knowledges, and experiences that exist there. "Over all these do I
                run, I fly; I dive on this side and that, as far as I can, and there is no end." If Augustine sounds
                like one of William Gibson's cowboys, he should,

                While the concept of using digital space to represent abstract data can be traced back to Ivan
                Sutherland in the 1960s, a particularly rich form of it was conjured up in a 1990 New York Times article
                on a Columbia research project partly funded by Citicorp. Researchers began developing a virtual reality
                system that allowed traders to use a special glove to manipulate 3D representations of options
                portfolios that changed as elements like interest rates shifted. And the virtual reality flagship
